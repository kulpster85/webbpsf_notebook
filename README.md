## Introduction
The purpose of this notebook is to provide some examples of how to use the WebbPSF trending API for JWST WFS&C Data.  Code excerpts and text extracted from: https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst_measured_opds.html

## InstallationÔÉÅ

Anaconda is the recommended Python distribution for this notebook. If you do not have it already, download Miniconda and install it (Python 3.7+ only). The instructions below assume you do not want webbpsf in your default Anaconda environment (base), but if you do want it, you can skip the part where you create a new conda environment.

In a Bash shell, create a new conda environment for wss_tools using Python 3 and then switch to that environment (skip this if you want to use default base environment, but using base is not recommended):

conda create -n wssenv python=3.8
conda activate wssenv

In that same environment, install the following dependencies using pip:

pip install astropy
pip install webbpsf 

## Installing WebbPSF and required data files
[Follow installation instructions on WebbPSF](https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

If you install via pip or manually, you must install the data files yourself.

Files containing such information as the JWST pupil shape, instrument throughputs, and aperture positions are distributed separately from WebbPSF. To run WebbPSF, you must download these files and tell WebbPSF where to find them using the WEBBPSF_PATH environment variable.

  1. Download the following file: [webbpsf-data-LATEST.tar](https://stsci.box.com/shared/static/qxpiaxsjwo15ml6m4pkhtk36c9jgj70k.gz) [approx. 70 MB]

  2. Untar webbpsf-data-LATEST.tar.gz into a directory of your choosing.

  3. Set the environment variable WEBBPSF_PATH to point to that directory. e.g.
